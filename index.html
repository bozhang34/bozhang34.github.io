<td align="left"><p>I am a Research Staff Member in the Mobile, Solutions, and Mathematical Sciences Department of the <a href="http://www.watson.ibm.com/index.shtml">IBM T.J. Watson Research Center</a>. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:bozhang@gatech.edu">bozhang@gatech.edu</a>.

<br />
There are three main aspects of my work: (1) developing new analytical tools for understanding real-world complexity and aiding decision-making, (2) conducting applied research, i.e., exploring the utility of existing analytical tools in different practical settings, (3) working with business leaders and practitioners to help them make more informed decisions. More specifically, I publish papers at academic journals, present research results at academic and industry conferences, influence client organizations&rsquo; strategic and operational decisions, file patents and invention disclosures, and develop and present proposals for project funding. 
<br />
<br />
I have held visiting researcher or scholar positions with the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, National University of Singapore, Columbia University, Bell Labs, New York University, and the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. I am the membership chairman of <a href="http://nymetro.chapter.informs.org/">the INFORMS New York Metropolitan Chapter</a>. I was involved in the launch of <a href="https://www.informs.org/Certification-Continuing-Ed/Analytics-Certification">Certified Analytics Professional</a> program, the world's first general analytics certification program. Specifically, I was on a committee responsible for writing and reviewing the very first set of exam questions and have since been continuing contributing to the exam item bank as the representative of <a href="https://www.informs.org/Community/APS">the INFORMS Applied Probability Society</a>.
<br />
<br />
In spring 2013, I taught a core undergraduate course IEOR 3402 Production Inventory Planning and Control in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University. Here is the <a href="http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~bzhang34/teacheval.pdf">teaching evaluation</a> that I received.
<br />
<br />
My current research focuses on three application areas: resource management and data security for information technology and systems (in particular, cloud computing and mobile technology-based systems), financial risk management, and decision-making for emerging healthcare practices. I am also working on IBM's Education Transformation initiative, developing new analytics assets in this area and being involved in client engagement.
<br />
<br /> 
I am curious about <i>all</i> ideas and methods on <i>how to do</i> predictive and prescriptive analytics, mathematical modeling and optimization, decision making and recommendation making in <i>different data environments</i>. In turn, I am very interested in synthesizing and developing relevant theories that provide useful guidance on these practices. Also, I continue discovering and working on interesting problems in queueing theory, my Ph.D. thesis area, or more broadly, the theory of stochastic systems. These problems include new theoretical questions, as well as novel applications and modifications of existing knowledge.
<br />
<br />
The real-world impact of my work has been recognized by an IBM Outstanding Innovation Award and several IBM Research Accomplishment awards. My research has also won the First Place in the 2010 INFORMS George Nicholson Student Paper Competition and the Best Student Paper in the 28th International Symposium on Computer Performance, Modeling, Measurements and Evaluation.
