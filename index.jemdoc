I am a Research Staff Member at the newly formed IBM Research AI (Artificial Intelligence) division. I am interested in synthesizing principles and ideas from different quantitative, scientific, and engineering disciplines, and furthermore applying them to guide the selection, development, and orchestration of more detailed methods for solving real world challenges in the era of AI.

I am organizing [http://e.ctt.bz/e.asp?e=B09B730C-21F2-410B-B8A2-7DAFBEA06EE9 a session on the interface between applied probability and machine learning] at [http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/phoenix2018/ INFORMS Annual Meeting 2018]. I am also on the program committee for the [https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-19/ AAAI 2019] and the [https://performance2018.sciencesconf.org/ IFIP Performance 2018].

I am currently working on mathematical modeling, probability, and optimization foundations of theoretical and applied problems in AI, machine learning, and statistics. I have been the chair of the [http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=149 Operations Research PIC] (Professional Interest Community) and a co-chair of the [http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=6657 Reasoning PIC] at IBM Research. I have held visiting scholar or adjunct faculty positions with New York University, Columbia University, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, Bell Labs, the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands, and National University of Singapore. I have a mathematical academic background with a specialization in applied probability and stochastic optimization. My Ph.D. thesis work done at Georgia Tech was on novel, important applications of the beautiful mathematical principle of asymptotics in stochastic (i.e., uncertain) environments, and part of the work won the First Place of 2010 INFORMS George E. Nicholson Student Paper Competition.

The theoretical problems and application areas that I have worked on are partly reflected by my papers and inventions
listed on this web page. You can contact me at [bozhang@gatech.edu] or [zhangbo@us.ibm.com].
#I have a deep mathematical background as well as broad professional and academic experiences. My Ph.D. thesis work was on novel, important applications of the beautiful mathematical principle of asymptotics in stochastic (i.e., uncertain) environments, and part of the work won the First Place of 2010 INFORMS George E. Nicholson Student Paper Competition, the most prestigious worldwide Ph.D. research paper competition in the field of Operations Research. During my career at IBM Research since July 2011, I have been a member of the winning team at an IBM Research Shark Tank contest for proposing a new direction with significant research and product potential and I have been awarded an IBM Outstanding Innovation Award for significant financial impacts of my project work.
